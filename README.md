# Tiktok-Analytics
This project is designed to classify videos into two categories: claim and opinion, based on their metadata, such as claim status, author ban status, and engagement metrics (likes, views). The aim is to assist researchers and developers working on content moderation, misinformation detection, or video categorization tasks.

The project also provides tools for data exploration and statistical insights to better understand the dataset before applying machine learning techniques.
